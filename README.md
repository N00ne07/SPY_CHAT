Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. 

One of the reasons that intruders can be successful is the most of the information they acquire from a system is in a form that they can read and comprehend. Intruders may reveal the information to others, modify it to misrepresent an individual or organization, or use it to launch an attack. One solution to this problem is, through the use of steganography. Steganography is a technique of hiding information in digital media. In contrast to cryptography, it is not to keep others from knowing the hidden information but it is to keep others from thinking that the information even exists. 

Steganography become more important as more people join the cyberspace revolution. Steganography is the art of concealing information in ways that prevents the detection of hidden messages. Steganography include an array of secret communication methods that hide the message from being seen or discovered. The main objective of the data hiding process using image steganography is to ensure security and a proper flow between two users.
Two important uses of data hiding in digital media are to provide proof of the copyright, and assurance of content integrity. Therefore, the data should stay hidden in a host signal, even if that signal is subjected to manipulation as degrading as filtering, resampling, cropping, or lossy data compression. Other applications of data hiding, such as the inclusion of augmentation data, need not be invariant to detection or removal, since these data are there for the benefit of both the author and the content consumer. Thus, the techniques used for data hiding vary depending on the quantity of data being hidden and the required invariance of those data to manipulation. Since no one method is capable of achieving all these goals, a class of processes is needed to span the range of possible applications.

The algorithm used for Encryption and Decryption in this application provides using several layers lieu of using only LSB layer of image.
